# crypto-buyauto-discord
A program that buys crypto in binance from signals in discord
How to use it. You must have python installed and 
pip install python-binance 
pip install jsonlib 
Go to settings.py and and you have to put your api key and secret.
Тhe minimum purchase for one transaction must be over 5$ if it is less it will not go through you can change the margin from settings.
The program is still in beta so you can test it at https://testnet.binancefuture.com/en/futures/ , but if you dont want that you can change it from True to False in settings.
In the future I will make it possible to be from more than one server channel for now it only allows one and I will make stoploss and takeprofit as well as support in bitget

You have to go trough all the coins in binance and select ISOLATED!!!!!!
